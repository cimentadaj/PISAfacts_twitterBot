## PISA Twitter Bot

This repository hosts a Twitter bot that randomly samples questions from the PISA 2015 suveys and makes an appropriate graph. It formally started tweeting on March 16th and tweets every day from Monday to Friday at 9:30 AM. You can find this bot at [@DailyPISA_Facts](https://twitter.com/DailyPISA_Facts). I created this bot using the R programming language. I've documented how I did in this [blogpost](https://cimentadaj.github.io/blog/2017-03-08-my-pisa-twitter-bot/my-pisa-twitter-bot/).
